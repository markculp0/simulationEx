## Overview:
This paper explores simulations on an Exponential Distribution.  

```{r}

# Set parameters for distribution
n <- 40 
lambda <- 0.2


# Generate random deviates for distribution
rexp(n, lambda)


# An exploratory plot 

```

## Simulations:  

```{r}
```

## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean
This distribution is centered at ...  The theoretical center, or mean of the distribution is centered at ...

```{r}
```

## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance
This distribution's variance is ... The theoretical  variance of this distribution would be ...



```{r}
```

## Distribution
We know this distribuion is normal because ...



Our conclusions and assumptions ... 

```{r}

hist(runif(1000))

#---

mns = NULL
for (i in 1:1000) mns = c(mns, mean(runif(40)))
hist(mns)


```
